# snap_game

My initial approach was to create a Card class where the suit and the number of the Card would be chosen. 

Then using instances of this Card class I would run a game of Snap using a SnapGame class. Each new game is a new instance of the SnapGame class. 

Different parts of the game are in different instance methods of SnapGame, such as the introduction, the first card and the loop with the conditionals after the first card

If I had time the next step would be to refactor the tests so they can all work on one cycle of the game.
